# Detailed design system

## Deterministic overlap evidence

The detector and receipt schemas are closed: unknown fields, duplicate issue
identities, malformed roles/evidence, invalid sidecar suffixes, and illegal
round transitions fail before state handling. `validate-markdown` validates the
machine receipt first, then resolves relative paths against the Markdown file's
directory and checks the unique marker, sidecar digest, and status.

The overlap detector emits `excalidraw.overlap-audit.v1` records. Canonical
UTF-8 JSON is sorted and compact, and the only permitted detached companion is
`<record>.json.sha256`. The repair loop is bounded to four rounds and three
edits; its decision relation is Pareto-based over issue identity and severity.
Receipts prove byte/sidecar agreement and internal replay only. They do not
establish authenticity, provenance, non-repudiation, trusted origin, tamper
proofness, or immutable history. External signatures, logs, anchors, and
trusted timestamps remain out of scope.

## Large / Comprehensive Diagram Strategy

**For comprehensive or technical diagrams, you MUST build the JSON one section at a time.** Do NOT attempt to generate the entire file in a single pass. This is a hard constraint: comprehensive diagrams can exceed common agent response budgets, and one-pass generation leads to worse quality. Section-by-section is better in every way.

### The Section-by-Section Workflow

**Phase 1: Build each section**

1. **Create the base file** with the JSON wrapper (`type`, `version`, `appState`, `files`) and the first section of elements.
2. **Add one section per edit.** Each section gets its own dedicated pass — take your time with it. Think carefully about the layout, spacing, and how this section connects to what's already there.
3. **Use descriptive string IDs** (e.g., `"trigger_rect"`, `"arrow_fan_left"`) so cross-section references are readable.
4. **Namespace seeds by section** (e.g., section 1 uses 100xxx, section 2 uses 200xxx) to avoid collisions.
5. **Update cross-section bindings** as you go. When a new section's element needs to bind to an element from a previous section (e.g., an arrow connecting sections), edit the earlier element's `boundElements` array at the same time.

**Phase 2: Review the whole**

After all sections are in place, read through the complete JSON and check:
- Are cross-section arrows bound correctly on both ends?
- Is the overall spacing balanced, or are some sections cramped while others have too much whitespace?
- Do IDs and bindings all reference elements that actually exist?

Fix any alignment or binding issues before rendering.

**Phase 3: Render & validate**

Now run the render-view-fix loop from the Render & Validate section. This is where you'll catch visual issues that aren't obvious from JSON — overlaps, clipping, imbalanced composition.

### Section Boundaries

Plan your sections around natural visual groupings from the diagram plan. A typical large diagram might split into:

- **Section 1**: Entry point / trigger
- **Section 2**: First decision or routing
- **Section 3**: Main content (hero section — may be the largest single section)
- **Section 4-N**: Remaining phases, outputs, etc.

Each section should be independently understandable: its elements, internal arrows, and any cross-references to adjacent sections.

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't generate the entire diagram in one response.** You will hit the output token limit and produce truncated, broken JSON. Even if the diagram is small enough to fit, splitting into sections produces better results.
- **Don't use a coding agent** to generate the JSON. The agent won't have sufficient context about the skill's rules, and the coordination overhead negates any benefit.
- **Don't write a Python generator script.** The templating and coordinate math seem helpful but introduce a layer of indirection that makes debugging harder. Hand-crafted JSON with descriptive IDs is more maintainable.

## Visual Pattern Library

### Fan-Out (One-to-Many)
Central element with arrows radiating to multiple targets. Use for: sources, PRDs, root causes, central hubs.
```
        ○
       ↗
  □ → ○
       ↘
        ○
```

### Convergence (Many-to-One)
Multiple inputs merging through arrows to single output. Use for: aggregation, funnels, synthesis.
```
  ○ ↘
  ○ → □
  ○ ↗
```

### Tree (Hierarchy)
Parent-child branching with connecting lines and free-floating text (no boxes needed). Use for: file systems, org charts, taxonomies.
```
  label
  ├── label
  │   ├── label
  │   └── label
  └── label
```
Use `line` elements for the trunk and branches, free-floating text for labels.

### Spiral/Cycle (Continuous Loop)
Elements in sequence with arrow returning to start. Use for: feedback loops, iterative processes, evolution.
```
  □ → □
  ↑     ↓
  □ ← □
```

### Cloud (Abstract State)
Overlapping ellipses with varied sizes. Use for: context, memory, conversations, mental states.

### Assembly Line (Transformation)
Input → Process Box → Output with clear before/after. Use for: transformations, processing, conversion.
```
  ○○○ → [PROCESS] → □□□
  chaos              order
```

### Side-by-Side (Comparison)
Two parallel structures with visual contrast. Use for: before/after, options, trade-offs.

### Gap/Break (Separation)
Visual whitespace or barrier between sections. Use for: phase changes, context resets, boundaries.

### Lines as Structure
Use lines (type: `line`, not arrows) as primary structural elements instead of boxes:
- **Timelines**: Vertical or horizontal line with small dots (10-20px ellipses) at intervals, free-floating labels beside each dot
- **Tree structures**: Vertical trunk line + horizontal branch lines, with free-floating text labels (no boxes needed)
- **Dividers**: Thin dashed lines to separate sections
- **Flow spines**: A central line that elements relate to, rather than connecting boxes

```
Timeline:           Tree:
  ●─── Label 1        │
  │                   ├── item
  ●─── Label 2        │   ├── sub
  │                   │   └── sub
  ●─── Label 3        └── item
```

Lines + free-floating text often creates a cleaner result than boxes + contained text.

## Shape Meaning

Choose shape based on what it represents—or use no shape at all:

| Concept Type | Shape | Why |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| Labels, descriptions, details | **none** (free-floating text) | Typography creates hierarchy |
| Section titles, annotations | **none** (free-floating text) | Font size/weight is enough |
| Markers on a timeline | small `ellipse` (10-20px) | Visual anchor, not container |
| Start, trigger, input | `ellipse` | Soft, origin-like |
| End, output, result | `ellipse` | Completion, destination |
| Decision, condition | `diamond` | Classic decision symbol |
| Process, action, step | `rectangle` | Contained action |
| Abstract state, context | overlapping `ellipse` | Fuzzy, cloud-like |
| Hierarchy node | lines + text (no boxes) | Structure through lines |

**Rule**: Default to no container. Add shapes only when they carry meaning. Aim for <30% of text elements to be inside containers.

## Color as Meaning

Colors encode information, not decoration. Every color choice should come from `references/color-palette.md` — the semantic shape colors, text hierarchy colors, and evidence artifact colors are all defined there.

**Key principles:**
- Each semantic purpose (start, end, decision, AI, error, etc.) has a specific fill/stroke pair
- Free-floating text uses color for hierarchy (titles, subtitles, details — each at a different level)
- Evidence artifacts (code snippets, JSON examples) use their own dark background + colored text scheme
- Always pair a darker stroke with a lighter fill for contrast

**Do not invent new colors.** If a concept doesn't fit an existing semantic category, use Primary/Neutral or Secondary.

## Modern Aesthetics

For clean, professional diagrams:

### Roughness
- `roughness: 0` — Clean, crisp edges. Use for modern/technical diagrams.
- `roughness: 1` — Hand-drawn, organic feel. Use for brainstorming/informal diagrams and for hand-drawn production deliverables (see Deliverables & Export).

**Default to 0** for most professional use cases.

### Stroke Width
- `strokeWidth: 1` — Thin, elegant. Good for lines, dividers, subtle connections.
- `strokeWidth: 2` — Standard. Good for shapes and primary arrows.
- `strokeWidth: 3` — Bold. Use sparingly for emphasis (main flow line, key connections).

### Opacity
**Use `opacity: 100` for all elements** — the one exception is zone/grouping containers, which use 25–40 so children stay visible. Use color, size, and stroke width to create hierarchy instead of transparency.

### Small Markers Instead of Shapes
Instead of full shapes, use small dots (10-20px ellipses) as:
- Timeline markers
- Bullet points
- Connection nodes
- Visual anchors for free-floating text

## Layout Principles

### Hierarchy Through Scale
- **Hero**: 300×150 - visual anchor, most important
- **Primary**: 180×90
- **Secondary**: 120×60
- **Small**: 60×40

### Whitespace = Importance
The most important element has the most empty space around it (200px+).

### Flow Direction
Guide the eye: typically left→right or top→bottom for sequences, radial for hub-and-spoke.

### Connections Required
Position alone doesn't show relationships. If A relates to B, there must be an arrow.

## Text Rules

**CRITICAL**: The JSON `text` property contains ONLY readable words.

**Language matching**: every reader-facing string follows the language of the user's
request (or the conversation's dominant language when the request is neutral), applied
consistently across titles, labels, and annotations. Preserve exact product names,
code identifiers, commands, API paths, and event names as-is — English identifiers
inside localized prose are correct; leaving the surrounding prose untranslated is not.

```json
{
  "id": "myElement1",
  "text": "Start",
  "originalText": "Start"
}
```

Settings: `fontSize: 16`, `textAlign: "center"`, `verticalAlign: "middle"`; `fontFamily: 3` (Cascadia) for the clean/modern preset, `1` (Virgil) for hand-drawn deliverables — decide per deliverable, never mix
